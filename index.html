	<p>
		Each node is a member of staff who has authored at least one paper, and the
		links represent the number of papers co-authored by each staff member.
	</p>

	<p>
		The sizes of the nodes vary with the total number of papers each author
		has written, and the widths of the links vary with the number of papers
		co-authored by each author-pair.
	</p>

	<p>
		The colours correspond to the different research groups each author belongs to.
	</p>

	<p>
		The data is loaded on runtime from a single JSON file, which specifies only
		which papers each staff member is credited with, in the following format:
		<code>
{
"people": {
"41": {
  "name": "Jessie Kennedy",
  "centre": "CISS",
  "publications": [
    "286105",
    "286263",
    "286267",
    "286277"
  ],
  "grants": [
    "13355681",
    "13355659",
    "13364427"
  ]
},
			</code>
		And the tool does the rest.
